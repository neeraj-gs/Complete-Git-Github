MERGING BRANCHES

With branches we can work on diffrent functionalities in parallel 
and then combine all together into a single feature

git merge -- command to merge a bracnh

No experiments are done on the main or master branch
	We always merge to the head bracnh or the branch where we are presnt on

First move over to the main brancch
THen merge the branch

there are diffrent pointers for diffret branchers
	to merge we just push head to till new branch

Fast Forward Merge
	No additional work on the main branch
		We just add additional commits on a branch and then to catch u[p we just move the pointer forward

It shows fast forward if it was a fast forward merge
	WE also get the extra other branch commits also to add to it with old commits of original branch


Git kraken is a GUI git terminal where we can easily try and visualize diffrent branches and our workflow

Anything ahead of the main branch has to be comited and made available to the main ones


Not all merges are fast forward merges
	If there is already some other commits done on the master or main but the branch doe snot have so no fast-forward


NON - CONFLICTING MERGING

If not a fast forward merge
	1.merge commit is generated
		git makes a commit on tthe for us ont he branch we are merging into bthat is reciepient branch


		When we do some work on main or master but we are still not known about the changes ddone 

	So now if we want to merge but main is already ahead of some commits

	now if we merge a branch a default editor is opened and a merge commit is auto done by git
	we can aslo add commit msg we want
	just close it the commit is completed



MERGING CONFLICTS 
 Depending on specific changes  , if same file is changed by diffrent files then there is conflict on which branch change hs to be kept

Manually resolving it is the only option

Resolving conflicts
Git tells us there is a conflict
OPen file and check if there are conflicts
Remove conflict markers and keep only mesage
Commit the changes after changing fiels

The content b/w == and >>>> is merged and considered 


RESOLVING CONFLICTS
	When same file is chagned in diffrent branches a conflict arises between them

	Go to editor it does the resolver problems in the file we are usign

	Just remove markere sand and keep whatever we want

	Add changes and then commit and then the result is what we have changed
