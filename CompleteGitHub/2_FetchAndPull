FETCHING AND PULLING
GETTING CHANGES FROM THE GITHUB INTO OUR SYSTEM

MASTER
	A REGULAR BRANCH REFERENE CAN ACT AS ANY OTHER SIMIALR BANCHES WEVE SEEN TILL NOW

ORIGIN/MASTER
	THIS IS A REMOTE TRACKING BRANCH,ITS A REFERENCE TO THE STATE OF THE MASTER BRANCH ON THE REMOTE.
	WE CANT MOVE IT MYSELF , ITS LIKE A BOOKMARK POINTING TO LAST COMMIT
	<remote branch>/<main_branch>


when we clone some repo 
we get a repo automaticalyl adn also sets a main tracking branch thats holds the most recently commited branch
	git branch -r // to see the branch references and remote branches

remote branch does not affect or doe snot chagne as it will stay where last ocmmit was prestn in the repo
	the changes we make will improve on and progress ahead

you rbranch is ahead of origin/main by n commits -- say we ahve made n commits from the branch we cloned from repo

	git checkout origin/master - -we will go where the project and how was it when we cloned it


We have to push it to ge tthe commits which are ahead into the branch



WORKING WITH REMOTE TRACKING BRANCHES
If there are multiple branches in the github repo
	when we clone the repo that has multiple branches

we will be first on the repo

By deafult when we clone it is sonnected ot remote branch by a deafult branch
main -> origin/main //conencted earlier only


If we want to workout on someother branch 
we have ot checkour to that branch and then we are in detached head sate

we can create new branch and work on it

git switch puppies // git automatically detects if a new bracnh and remote branch is same then it will automatically track the other branch
simialr to ho wmain->origin/main

git switch <remotebranch> //we have a branch that has a relationship as 
<newbranch> -> origin/remote branch

Older way
git checkout --track origin/branch_name

	jsut git switch and we move and can start working onthat branch where we want to

jsut like main we can push main into other rbanches as we want to

may not exist locally git will automatically set it up and senf it to you


FETCHING AND PULLING

Say we jsut cloned a repo form github
we do some work and also work with collaborators and those collaborators ahve already pushed some on github but we ahve not having on local comp

Git fetch  and git pull
	2 commnds ot get new commits from github

git fetch -takes changes from github into a local repo and not a working directry
	doneload chages from remote repo and not integrated into our files

git fetch <remote>
remote defaults to origin
	it fetches branches and history from a specific remote repository.it only updates remote tracking branches


git fetch <remote> <branch>
	to just fetch from one branch

In fetching remote branch will update to the altest one

the local branch is untouched 
	we have jsut downlaoded and not integrated to teh work we ahve done


Fetch is done when there is some chagnes by collaborators and that is not available on our local changes

When we push up cahges from their own lcoal repo cha ges are seen on github but not presnr in out local one


git fetch origin // to get all cahnges
git fetch origin branch //to get changes of particualr branch

git status
	we see  out rbach is behinfd n commits so we can come to know it was updated

origin/branch is now pointitn gto a new place and we dont have it in our local repo

	we cab checkout and see the changes

To integrate chagnes we have to use PULL COMMAND

GIT PULL IS USED OT UPDATE OUR LCOAL BRANCH

Fetching is also use dot find if some new branches were created or not 
	Local repo knwos about it whne we ftech

git pull is similar ot fetch but pull will also updates our HEAD or working directry branch

git pull = git fetch + git merge

git pull <remote> <branch>

Where we run git pull matters and on that branch the changes are merged onto teh current branch


pulls can result in conflicts and we can resolve conflicts simialr to normal merges


If no mege conflicts easy to pulla and merge
If there are merge conflicts
	If changing same fiels


before we push alwsy pull and check if there are any conflcits
	Go to file and and see and keep chagnes what we want and then push it

Always pull down first before we push something onto github



A SHORTER SYNTAX FOR GIT PULL
git pull // no need ot specify remote or branch as well
	remmote defaultsto origin
	branch defaults to current branch we are on
