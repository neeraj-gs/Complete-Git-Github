GITHUB GRABS: ODDS AND ENDS

GITHU REPO VISIBILITY
PUBLIC VS PRIVATE REPOSITORIE SON GITHUB

WE CAN MAKE VISIBILITY PRIVATE AND PUBLIC

PUBLIC - ACCESSIBLE ADN DISCOVERABLE AND CLONABLE BY EVERYINE ON INTERNET
ANYONE CAN SEE THE REPO ON GITHUB
	BUT CANT PUSH AS THEY NEED COLLABORATOR PERMMISSIONS

PRIVATE
	ONLY THE OWNERS AND EXPLICITLY ADDED COLLABORATORS CAN ACCESS THEM AND USE THEM

SETTINGS --> REPO->LONG DOWN IN DANGER ZONE --> CHANGE VISIBILITY --> AMKE IT PRIVATE OR PUBLIC
	ANYTHING INVOLVING PUBLIC GOES AWAY IF WE MAKR IT PRIVATE

START SOMETHING NI PRIVATE AND THEN MAKE THEM INTO PUBLIC IF YOU WANT TO SHOWCASE OR ADD COLLABORATORS



ADDING COLLABORATORS
ALLOWING OTHER USERS TO PUSH CAHNGES TO THE REPOSITORY
REPO --> SETTINGS-->MANAGE ACCESS -->INVITE A COLLABORATOR [USERNAME OR EMAIL] -- >CLICK LINKA ND ACCEPT INVITATION -->THEN THE ACCEPTED PERSON CAN ALSO START CONTRIBUTING TO THE REPO

COLLABORATOR CAN ALSO PUSH CAHNGES
BUT COLLABORATOR DOE SNOT HAVE ACCESS TO SETTINGS OF THE REPO
ONLY OWNER AHS THE RIGHTS OF SETTINGS
