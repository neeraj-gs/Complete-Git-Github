The Very Basics of Git

Repository[Repo]
It is a workspace which tracks and amnages files within a folder
	anytime we want to use git we need to create a repo , we can have any number of repos on our machine
We have to initialise a git repo in the folder we wnat to
Diffrent repos have diffrent histories or logs

Commands:
git status -- gives information on the current status of the git repos
	it works only in a git repo

git init -- initialize a new repo whereever we are in the terminal
	we do this once per project . initialise in teh top level folder

Whenever we run a git init or initialize a git repo a new directry called .git is created as .folders are hidden
	rm -rf .git --- removes the entire git history of the project and also removes teh initialized project

Common Issue:
	Git tracks a directry and all the sub directry
	top down folders are nested and tracked by git

	Never do init inside of an existing repository
		Difficult for git to track these.

Commiting Workflow:
	It is the most important git feature
	Adding checkpoints to project means commiting it
		Any message along with snap is the commit

Working Directry
Make Changes in a directry

Staging Area
Stage all the changes of untracked files

Commit the changes

git add - staging commands that is all the untracked fies are tracked adn slected before making a commit
	Simialr to grouping the files are making the commit for these

	Commands:
		git add file1 file2
		git add . -- adds all untracked files

git commit
use dot make a commit from the staging area that we grouped them into

	Commit message should summarize changes made at that particualr commit

	git commit -- it will open an editor to add the mesage
	git commit -m "mesage we want to provide" -- add directly without asking msg as a secondary step


git log
	it jsut retrieves info of log of commits
	For each commit
		Author is present -- it is done using git config
		Date is present
		Commit message at the bottom is present
	commit Hash  -- is also rpesnt
		the latest commit is present ont hte top
